## Description

This website was a semester long project for my Intro to Web Dev Class taught by Conrad Kennington at Boise State Univeristy.
It is primarily writen in PHP with some SQL for Database management and JavaScript with JQuerry for some extra functionality.
The goal of this website was to gain familiarity with PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in a structured yet fun way. The idea behind
the website was my own but there were guidelines that needed to be follwed for content, design, and minimum functionality.
Currently the website is in a mostly functional state with only a few unimplemented features and known bugs.

## Hosting
This website is currently hosted live. For a demonstration please reach out to me and I can set up a meeting or send you the
website link for a "self guided tour".
